## Curves from lines
 - Linear regression is not "linear", it is "additive"!
 - We definitely can produce paths out of linear models that are not line but curves.
 - One way: polynomials.
   - Downside: *polynomial grief*. Polynomials have to turn N times. 
 - Another way: splines.
   - Splines are better than polynomials, but equally geocentric.
